With the huge population movement, the development of tourism plays a vital role for Shanghai.

It combines the accessibility of the three major transportation of the airport, railway station, and bus station. Its convenience is the highest for tourists, and it is the most suitable for them as the first stop to visit after arrival. From red to yellow to blue, the accessibility of major transportation facilities is getting lower and lower. The blue dot has the lowest connection with external transportation facilities, which can be found that most of them are distributed outside the city, so it is suitable for local residents.</span>

The distances selected are 3000 meters and 5000 meters respectively. The small range is from the various scenic spots along the city road, spreading out of the range of 3000 meters, shown in red; the large represents the spread of 5000 meters, shown in yellow. This module uses ArcGIS to operate and is used to evaluate the accessibility of scenic spots, that is, it can be used as a selection criterion when tourists want to visit multiple scenic spots.</span>
